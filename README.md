# Belly Bacteria Samples analysis
## Overview
Using a base of samples of bacteria taken from various test subjects from their belly buttons. A website is created in order to have a more fluid and dynamic way to visualize the data for each test subject and determine which bacteria is the best for the synthesis of meat.

## Results
The dashboard can be seen in the github pages of this repo and shows the following:

At the top we have the title of the site inside a jumbotron class from Bootstrap. Going down we have three elements, from left to right, the first elements are the dropdown menu to choose the test subject then a little box where important information of the subject is shown, then we have a bar chart showing the types of bacteria found in the sample of the subject and finally a gauge which shows the washing frequency of the subject.

Finally at the end of the site a bubble chart is generated showing the bacteria and sizes found in the sample of the subject.

## Conclusion
As a first approach to the project I find it to be pretty good, improvements can be made more on the styling of the graphs perhaps and also maybe adding an additonal graph to show something extra. A part from that the proyect as challenging and interesting to hone my data visualization skills.
